              <p>As an AI system will become more powerful and more general, it would become super intelligent – superior to human performance in many or almost all domains. While this could sound like science fiction, many studies leaders believe it feasible. Were it possible, it might be as transformative economically, socially, and politically as the industrial revolution. This ought to lead to extremely positive developments but could also probably pose catastrophic dangers from accidents (safety) or security.</p>
              <br><br><br>
              <p>
                  <strong>On safety: </strong>Our current systems often go incorrect in unpredictable ways. There are several tough technical problems related to the design of accident-free artificial-intelligence. Aligning current systems’ behavior with our desires has proved difficult and has ended in unpredictable negative outcomes. Accidents caused by a much extra effective machine could be far more destructive.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                  <strong>On security: </strong>A super intelligent AGI might be an economic and military asset to its possessor, perhaps even giving it a decisive strategic advantage. Were it in the hands of bad actors they may use it in dangerous ways. If two groups competed to develop it first, it might have the destabilizing dynamics of an hands race.
                  <br>
                  Superintelligence could be possible within this century, it could be transformative and have negative consequences, and it may be that we will do useful work right now. Therefore, it is worth taking seriously and for some people to dedicate serious effort and idea to the problem.
                  <br>
                  Also, artificial intelligence causes many risks that affect the future, such as: unemployment, no original creativity, complex machines and it requires huge costs.
